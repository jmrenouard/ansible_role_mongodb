# 🎯 OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES

$$DYNAMIC_CONTEXT$$

# priority TASKS

* [ ] Implement MongoDB Replica Set orchestration in Ansible.
* [ ] Ensure 100% idempotency across all role tasks.
* [ ] Validate standalone and cluster scenarios via Molecule.
* [ ] Maintain high linting score (0 errors in ansible-lint).

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Coverage:** All common scenarios (standalone, shard, cluster) have Molecule tests.
2. **Efficiency:** Role execution time is optimized by minimizing redundant tasks.
3. **Robustness:** Role handles partial failures and restarts gracefully.
4. **Documentation:** README.md updated with all available role variables and Molecule usage.
